<h4>A Facial Recognition Attendance System with time tracking is a comprehensive solution that combines facial detection, recognition, and attendance recording along with timestamp information. Here's a detailed description of how such a system typically operates:
</h4>
<h1>Add faces to the database</h1>
Firstly,We add the faces of 100 pictures and then it store in the data base.
<h1>Facial Detection Test</h1>

As individuals approach the attendance system, cameras equipped with facial detection capabilities capture images of their faces. The system identifies and extracts facial features from these images.
<h1>Feature Extraction:</h1>

The system analyzes the facial features to create a unique facial template or signature. This template is a mathematical representation of the individual's facial characteristics.
<h1>Template Matching:</h1>

The extracted facial template is compared against the enrolled templates in the system's database. Advanced matching algorithms determine the similarity between the captured face and the stored templates.
<h1>Attendance Recording:</h1>

If a match is successful, indicating the recognition of the individual, the system records the attendance along with a timestamp indicating the exact time of the attendance event. This timestamp is crucial for tracking attendance records accurately.
<h1>Real-time Integration:</h1>

The attendance information is integrated in real-time with attendance management software or databases. This integration allows for immediate updates and easy access to attendance records.
<h1>Logging and Reporting:</h1>

The system logs all attendance events, including the individual's identity, timestamp, and any relevant metadata. Reports can be generated for administrators or HR personnel, providing insights into attendance patterns and trends.
